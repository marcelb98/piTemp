# piTemp
piTemp gives you the availability to show and track temperatures measured by DS1820-sensors.  
You can access the tracked temperatures over HTTP.

Initially piTemp was developed for Raspberry Pi, but it should run on every Linux with Python3 and PostgreSQL.

piTemp has also integrated support for the [tempSrvr-API](https://github.com/marcelb98/tempSrvr). Just make sure to specify the server-URL in the config
file and to store the API credentials of the sensors and you'll see your temperatures online.
